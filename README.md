# Algorithm Challenge #38 – Trim Left, Trim Right, and Trim (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program reads a string and removes unnecessary spaces from:
- The left side (leading spaces)
- The right side (trailing spaces)
- Both sides (full trim)

The trimming process is implemented manually without using built-in helpers,
to emphasize low-level string traversal and algorithmic control.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Character-by-character string inspection
- Traversing strings from left-to-right and right-to-left
- Removing unwanted characters without modifying core data
- Writing clean and reusable helper functions
- Understanding text normalization in software systems

---

🧩 Example
-
**Input:**

" Ali Saleh "

**Output:**

Trim Left = "Ali Saleh    "

Trim Right = "    Ali Saleh"

Trim = "Ali Saleh"

📂 File Information

- **Language:** C++
- **File Name:** trim_string.cpp
- **Challenge Level:** Level 3
- **Challenge Number:** #38

💬 Notes
-
String trimming is a critical operation in:
- User input validation
- Data cleaning pipelines
- Configuration file parsing
- Text normalization before storage or comparison

This challenge reinforces the idea that
**small utilities often play a big role in system reliability.**
